## 🎯 Journey Overview

This repository documents my systematic journey to becoming a Backend/Platform Engineer with SRE ownership. Rather than collecting tutorials, I'm building real systems, breaking them deliberately, learning from failures, and documenting every step.

**Philosophy**: Build, Break, Learn, Document, Iterate

---

## 📦 What I'm Building

### Phase 1: Service Foundations (Weeks 1-4)
**Status**: 🟡 In Progress

A production-grade backend service with:
- Clear service boundaries and API contracts
- Comprehensive failure handling (timeouts, retries, circuit breakers)
- Observability (metrics, logging, tracing)
- Structured approach to reliability

**Key Artifacts**:
- [ ] Service Boundaries Document
- [ ] Failure Modes & Recovery Strategies
- [ ] Observability Dashboard & Documentation

---

### Phase 2: Production Operations (Weeks 5-8)
**Status**: ⚪ Not Started

Production deployment with chaos engineering:
- Cloud deployment (AWS/GCP/Azure)
- Chaos testing and failure injection
- Incident response and recovery
- Security hardening

**Key Artifacts**:
- [ ] Deployment configurations
- [ ] Chaos experiment results
- [ ] Incident reports with timelines

---

### Phase 3: Platform Thinking (Weeks 9-12)
**Status**: ⚪ Not Started

Building reusable platform components:
- Abstractions that work across services
- Developer experience improvements
- Reliability patterns as code

**Key Artifacts**:
- [ ] Reusable deployment templates
- [ ] Observability bootstrap library
- [ ] Authentication middleware

### Phase 4: Communication & Portfolio (Weeks 13-16)
**Status**: ⚪ Not Started

Technical communication demonstrating ownership:
- Architecture decision documents
- Incident postmortems
- Scaling analysis
- Technical writing samples

**Key Artifacts**:
- [ ] Architecture document
- [ ] Detailed postmortem
- [ ] Scaling analysis

## 🎯 Learning Methodology

This isn't a collection of tutorial projects. It's a systematic approach to building production competence:

1. **Build with intent** - Every service has explicit boundaries and design decisions
2. **Break deliberately** - Chaos testing reveals gaps between theory and practice
3. **Document failures** - Incident reports capture learning from breakage
4. **Iterate relentlessly** - Artifacts evolve as understanding deepens
5. **Communicate clearly** - Technical writing proves you can explain your work

**Core Practice**: Answer three questions every week:
- What failed?
- What signal caught it?
- What decision mattered?
